# Warism — Roadmap

What is still to do after `release-2026-11-03` (ADR-805, the user's decision). PLAN.md and
`docs/PLAN_DONE.md` are the frozen record of the build up to that release.

Rules:
- Work top-down. "continue" means the first unchecked item (PROMPT.md).
- Each item says what it is for, its acceptance test (`AT:` names a figure, its bar and the run that
  reads it, or the case that must hold; ADR-554), and the rules it adds to a checker, when it changes
  a sim rule (ADR-803, ADR-804).
- An item too big for one sitting is split into lettered parts (R3a, R3b), one level only.
- Tick it (`- [x]`) in the commit that finishes it, with one line under it: the commit and the
  evidence. Ticked items stay until the batch's release, then move to CHANGELOG.md.
- A batch ends with a critic run and a release tag (`release-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, PROMPT.md "Releases"; a
  second on one day takes a letter, `release-2026-11-03b`, ADR-820).

## Released

- `release-2026-11-03b` (2026-11-03): R0a–R0i and Batch 1 (R1–R5, R7–R15), in CHANGELOG.md for
  players; the items with their evidence in `docs/history/ROADMAP-release-2026-11-03b.md`.

## Later

- [ ] R6 **SPEC.md as the game is.** The rest of SPEC.md after R0i: each section rewritten to what
  the code does now, the history left to DECISIONS. Rules of the rewrite: ADR-821. Each part's AT:
  its section added to `tests/unit/specRefs.test.ts` at 0 misses, and every constant it states read
  from the code, listed with file and line in PROGRESS.
  - [x] R6a The references checker (`tools/spec/refs.ts`) and §10, testing and verification (§2's
    three stale names fixed).
    Done (ADR-821): `specRefs.test.ts` 4 of 4; §10 had 6 misses at HEAD (parity, critic:due), 0 now.
  - [ ] R6b §3.1–3.3: map, cells, provinces, cities and zones. The test judges whole sections: add
    `'3'` (§3.4–3.7 have no miss now) and call §3.1–3.3 current in SPEC's header until R6c.
  - [ ] R6c §3.4–3.7: nations, diplomacy, military, tech and production.
  - [ ] R6d §4: territory, fronts and the strategic layer.
  - [ ] R6e §5: combat.
  - [ ] R6f §6.1–6.2: armour and the navy. As R6b: add `'6'`; §6.1–6.2 current until R6g.
  - [ ] R6g §6.3–6.4: aircraft and nuclear weapons.
  - [ ] R6h §7: the AI.
  - [ ] R6i §8: semantic zoom.
  - [ ] R6j §9: UI and UX.
